This search engine uses a php code and mysql database, use the crawling bot to create your own database after crateing the database name and tables of your choice or same name as in the code stated below:

create databse name- searchengine

create table- sites with the following columns: id, url, title, description, keywords, timesvisited.

create table- images with the following columns: id, siteurl, imageurl, alt, title, timesvisited.

previously i had added each file seperately but this caused the MD5 hash to differ from the original so i uploaded the zip file directly so its MD% doesnt change and deleted the rest.
